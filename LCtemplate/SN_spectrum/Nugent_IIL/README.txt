This SN IIL spectrum templates are constructed from Peter Nugent's published template.

The original table is split into 12 files according to their rest-frame date (epoch).
Note that the number in the filename does not represent "day after maximum".
For each file, column #1 is wavelength[\AA] and column #2 is flux.

You can download the original template from the site below:

This SN Ia spectrum templates are constructed from Eric Hsiao's published template.

The original table is split into 101 files according to their rest-frame date (epoch).
For example, "spectrum_p57" represents the spectrum of SN Ia at +57 day after its maximum light.
For each file, column #1 is wavelength[\AA] and column #2 is flux.
